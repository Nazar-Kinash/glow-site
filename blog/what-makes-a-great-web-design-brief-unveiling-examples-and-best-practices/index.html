It acts as a navigational aid, guiding designers and clients through the complexities of the project. The essence of the brief is to clarify the purpose of the site, its aesthetic orientation, and target audience.</p><p>It is much easier to understand the essence of the brief with real-world examples. That’s why we suggest you consider a real example on which you can understand the nature and value of the brief:</p><ul><li>Sweet Delights, a small bakery, is looking for a web presence to expand its customer base and facilitate online orders. The brief describes a warm, inviting brand emphasizing handmade and artisanal products. The target audience is locals, targeting those who appreciate quality baked goods and personalized service.</li></ul><p>Now, let’s do a comparative analysis on the key components we described above:</p><p><strong>Project Overview</strong></p><p>The brief clearly states the bakery’s goal of expanding its reach through an online platform. It provides context for the <a href="https://www.designrush.com/agency/ui-ux-design/trends/ux-design-process" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">design process</a>.</p><p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p><p>Identifying locals who appreciate quality baked goods helps the designer tailor the website to the preferences and needs of a specific audience.</p><p><strong>Branding Insights</strong></p><p>The emphasis on a warm and inviting brand is consistent with the artisanal nature of the bakery. The brief provides recommendations for maintaining a consistent brand image online.</p><p><strong>Design Preferences</strong></p><p>The mention of a warm and inviting brand suggests a design that includes friendly colors, attractive bakery images, and an overall cozy aesthetic.</p><p><strong>Technical Requirements</strong></p><p>The requirement to make it easier to accept online orders points to the need for e-commerce functionality. It influences the choice of platforms and technologies for seamless online transactions.</p><p>This example demonstrates how a well-structured brief ensures that the web designer understands the unique characteristics of the bakery and its target audience.
