<h2 id="p1">Introduction</h2>
<p>
  In early 2024, Lifer Diabetes approached <a href="https://glow.team/">Glow Design Agency</a> with a challenge. They needed a modern healthcare platform. Their goal was to help diabetes patients track and manage their condition effectively. The existing solutions in the market lacked user-friendly interfaces and comprehensive features.
</p>
<p>
  Our team recognized the opportunity to make a real difference in patients' lives. We understood that proper design could significantly impact healthcare outcomes. The project required a delicate balance between functionality and accessibility.

<h2 id="p3">Objectives and Goals</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://glow.team/about/">Our design team</a> identified key goals for this healthcare platform project. Each objective focused on creating an accessible and engaging user experience.
</p>
<p>
  The main design objectives included:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a clean, modern visual system that inspires trust</li>
  <li>Design an intuitive navigation system for quick access to vital features</li>
  <li>Develop a consistent color palette that aids in data visualization</li>
  <li>Build a responsive interface that works seamlessly across all devices</li>
  <li>Craft clear typography hierarchies for improved readability</li>
  <li>Design an engaging onboarding flow for first-time users</li>
  <li>Create an accessible interface for users with different abilities</li>
  <li>Develop a clear visual system for alerts and notifications</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We aimed to <a href="https://glow.team/blog/the-art-of-balance-navigating-functionality-and-aesthetics-in-design/">balance modern aesthetics with functional design</a>. Our priority was making complex health data easy to understand. The interface needed to feel professional yet friendly.
</p>
<p>
  Each design element needed to support users in their daily health management. We focused on creating visual patterns that users could learn quickly.
</p>

<h2 id="p4">Approach and Methodology</h2>
<p>
  We started with a deep dive into the visual language of healthcare applications. Our team analyzed the design patterns of five leading diabetes management apps.
</p>
<p>
  The six-week research phase included several key design activities:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Review of current <a href="https://glow.team/blog/future-trends-in-ux-design/">UX</a>/UI trends in healthcare applications</li>
  <li>Analysis of color psychology in medical interfaces</li>
  <li>Study of typography impact on readability for various age groups</li>
  <li>Evaluation of button placement and size for emergency functions</li>
  <li>Testing of different navigation patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Our design research revealed three distinct interface needs:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simple, high-contrast layouts for elderly users</li>
  <li>Dynamic, feature-rich interfaces for tech-savvy patients</li>
  <li>Data-focused dashboards for medical professionals</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We created mood boards and style guides for each user group. It helped align our design decisions with user preferences and needs.
</p>
<p>
  Each interface concept went through multiple iterations of design testing. We focused on creating familiar patterns that users could easily understand. The final direction combined accessibility with modern design trends.

<h2 id="p5">Design Processes</h2>
<h3 id="p6">User Research and Analysis</h3>
<p>
  We conducted detailed user interviews and surveys. It helped us understand pain points in diabetes management. We created user journey maps for each persona. These insights guided our design decisions.
</p>
<p>
  Our research identified critical pain points:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Complex data entry processes discouraged regular tracking</li>
  <li>Unclear data visualization made trend-spotting difficult</li>
  <li>Poor integration with medical devices caused frustration</li>
  <li>Lack of emergency support features creates anxiety</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="p7">Information Architecture</h3>
<p>
  Our team developed a clear hierarchy of information. We organized features by frequency of use. The navigation system prioritized daily management tasks. Emergency information remained easily accessible.
</p>
<p>
  We implemented a three-click rule for all critical features. The information architecture underwent five iterations based on user testing. Card sorting sessions helped optimize menu structures.
</p>
<h3 id="p8">Wireframing and Prototyping</h3>
<p>
  We created low-fidelity wireframes for key features. User testing helped refine these early designs. Interactive prototypes allowed for real-world usage testing.
