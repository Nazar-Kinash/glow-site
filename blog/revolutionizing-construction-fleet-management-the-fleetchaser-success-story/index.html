<h2 id="p2">The Challenge: Automating Construction Fleet Management</h2>

<p>
  The construction industry, estimated to be worth $1,293 billion in 2019 in the
  U.S. alone, has long-needed process automation. The sector employs more than
  180 million people worldwide and has a projected global output of $12.9
  trillion by 2022. The potential for improvement is enormous, and with our
  solution, we can help you tap into this potential. However, only 18% of
  companies were using specialized fleet management applications.
</p>
<p>
  FleetChaser recognized this gap and created a solution specifically for the
  construction sector. <br> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ruslan-mashatov-0b794aa9_autonomous-vehicles-transforming-last-mile-activity-7211684651013214208-2cUH?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">We aimed</a> to develop a system to help construction
  companies keep their fleet in optimal condition and manage it easily.
