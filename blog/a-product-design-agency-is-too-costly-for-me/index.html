                “Ok, this will be a text where you try to reason big budgets of
                your agency” — you might have thought. And you are correct but
                please, let me elaborate a little.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regardless of whether you are launching a startup or trying to
                update an existing product — you must be sure to hire the right
                people. There are pros and cons in working with agencies as well
                as with individual freelancers and we want to dive into this
                specific topic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let’s build a situation: You have your own business, naturally,
                you want the business to grow and develop. However, at time you
                don’t have enough people, knowledge in some specifics, and
                definitely not enough time to control all the processes. It’s
                your business and you are already in charge of development,
                client communications, advertisement, hiring, legal, and
                financial issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is a very common situation for most entrepreneurs.
                Eventually, you will come to a point where you need to scale up
                your business, attract more clients, or relaunch a product from
                scratch. In all of these cases, after a quick research, you will
                understand that it’s time for a new product design. A few more
                hours of surfing will show that “design” is a complex term and
                there are many specific fields inside of it. Just to name a few:
                product design, mobile apps design, illustration, animation,
                research methods and so much more.
              </p>
              <p>
                After reading into the goals, differences in processes of each
                filed you can conclude that it’s not worth your time and it will
                be better to hire some specialists. You go to Google and soon
                enough u get to Dribbble, Behance, and Clutch. Here you can look
                through hundreds of profiles and portfolios. And there are so
                many of them and the prices have quite a range; some people
                promise a result, others brag about their cool processes,
                somebody is showing off their collaborations with Bentley,
                Google or Facebook. But, the main idea you will get from all
                these profiles is a simple division in two groups of
                specialists: freelancers and agencies.

                A tough question right away, especially when you are not quite
                sure what you need. “I want a good design” is a very ambiguous
                thing to say. The lack of a documented detailed description of
                the product, list of competitors, or list of differences from
                existing products are all a common problem for startup
                entrepreneurs. You can’t aim for a good result if you don’t know
                what you are aiming for.

              <p>
                The first thing to consider is, of course, the price: agencies
                are always more expensive. And there are reasons for it: the
                staff, office rent, coffee machine maintenance, etc. On the
                other hand, there are freelancers — specialists who can work
                from anywhere provided with a laptop and a network connection.
                Let’s dig in some nuances:
              </p>
              <p>
                Freelancers, most of the time, are a design one-man-army: a
                single person can make a you a website design, work with the
                layout, set up targeting, and give you many advices and
                recommendations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Agencies do all of the above and a bit more but it costs three
                times the freelance price. “Why should I pay more?” you might
                ask. Because it gives more guarantees for you. Product design is
                a very complex field with different stages; let us list the main
                of them:<br />First, we schedule a discovery call when we get to
                know why and how your product works.<br />Then, we commit a deep
                research of your product and competitors.<br />With the
                information in hand, we create a Customer Journey Map (CJM) to
                help us understand how users are going to use your product.<br />Afterwards
                is the wireframe stage full of black and white images but, when
                done correctly, this stage can help you save hundreds of
                thousands of dollars and tens of hours of your time.<br />All of
                the above will result in a well thought concept of how your
                product will look like.
              </p>
              <p>
                In terms of planning and result guarantees agencies have the
                upper hand. Hiring an agency the customer can be sure that a
                specialist will handle each field. The copywriter will provide
                quality text; the marketer will set up advertisement;
                SEO-specialist will promote the site; programmers will write the
                code for new features; designers will work through the stages
                listed above (and do much more). Also it is important that a
                project manager will be the captain of this crew — being the
                link between client requests and agency tasks completion.

                Freelancers will be enough for some tasks but hiring a
                freelancer always come with some risks. If you are not satisfied
                with the work done by a specialist and you decide to change
                them, will the newcomer have the knowledge about all the work
                done by their predecessor? For instance, the newcomer has no
                information on the committed audience testing and the results of
                what works better and what does not work at all. That might
                drive the newcomer to start the process all over again and
                replicate the mistakes already fixed by their predecessor.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, bringing a new specialist to the project takes a lot of
                time. The newcomer must relearn all the details and get to know
                their colleagues. We must not forget that we are all human
                beings and can get ill; in case of freelance, it results in
                delays. It is much more common for freelancers to drop out of
                projects. In addition, for a company each change of personnel
                means a re-sign of contracts and NDAs, production and adjustment
                of the new strategy and many more time-consuming steps.

                To avoid all the concerns from the previous paragraph it is best
                to hire an agency. Moreover, a mature agency always keep their
                projects under control and take responsibility in their actions.
                This approach minimizes the chaos of a new project and any time
                losses it can cause.
              </p>
              <p>
                In agencies, all the work done within your project stays in one
                team and one document. For example, in our workflow each project
                is a group of tasks in a CRM system (Asana or Clickup), and a
                Figma board for design (however, we can work in most of other
                design tools).
              </p>
              <p>
                For a business owner it is natural to want to improve their
                business, make it more successful and increase profits. How can
                a design agency help?
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  High competence — each specialist in the team is assigned to
                  their field of work accordingly;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Well-coordinated team — no need for additional human
                  resources, great communication inside and outside the team;
                </li>
                <li>
                  In touch — they never drop out and are motivated to
                  collaborate and help as long as needed;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Assigned project manager — a specialist who can answer any
                  question about digital marketing
                </li>
                <li>
                  Timely completion of tasks — if any member of the team can’t
                  meet the deadline they can get help from colleagues;
                </li>
                <li>
                  No legal issues — easier to sign contracts and NDAs than with
                  individual specialists.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2 id="p43230318383572296">
                Ok, I’ve made my mind. Where should I find specialists?

                If you are aiming for freelancers, I would recommend to start
                looking by a word-of-mouth; ask friends and colleagues for a
                trusted specialist.
              </p>
              <p>
                If nobody can give you a trustworthy contact, check the sites
                were design freelancers gather the most:
              </p>
              <ul>

                Whether you choose a freelancer or an agency for your project
                depends on personal perforations and the type of work that needs
                to be done. Big and complex projects should be outsourced to
                agencies, while a freelancer will do for simple and quick tasks.
                It is entirely up to you to decide.
              </p>
              <p>
